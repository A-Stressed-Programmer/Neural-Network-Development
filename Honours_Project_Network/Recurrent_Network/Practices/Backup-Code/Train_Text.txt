        Train Basic RNN cell model

        Basic RNN cell, shared values of weights and biases at all stages of unrolled RNN's,
        Weights [U]Input, [W]Recurrance, [V]Outputs are shared through out the Tensor contruction.

        Design;
        The train stage will feed all data from stock market .Csv file into main network, to allow
        error training to optimize to the shape of the data.
